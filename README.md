# Student-List-Management-System
This C program gives the user multiple choices (add, remove, display all students, display all students in a class, search, add course, and quit) regarding a list of students, and saves all information in the linked list onto a file before the program is terminated.Program deals with memory management and leak prevention, pointer and pointer to pointer operations accessing structured data, solving problems with recursion, parameter passing. 

# What I Learned
- Pointer and pointer to pointer operations accessing structured data
- Linked list of structures, with complex manipulations of pointer and structure
- Different types of parameter passing mechanisms and return values of different types. 
- Solving problems in recursion
